    An example of how to spin up a deployment and configure it in a single plan.

# 

A common scenario for using the Elastic Stack provider, is to manage & configure Elastic Cloud deployments.
In order to do that, we'll use both the Elastic Cloud provider, as well as the Elastic Stack provider.
Start off by configuring the two providers in a `provider.tf` file for example:

{{ tffile "examples/cloud/provider.tf" }}

Notice that the Elastic Stack  provider is not configured, since we'll be using an `elasticsearch_connection` block
for each of our resources, to point to the Elastic Cloud deployment. This is because `terraform` can not configure providers that are dependent on one another.

Next, we'll set up an Elastic Cloud `ec_deployment` resource, which represents an Elastic stack deployment on Elastic Cloud.
We shall configure the deployment using the credentials that it outputs once created

{{ tffile "examples/cloud/deployment.tf" }}
